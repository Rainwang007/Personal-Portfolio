# Rain's Personal Portfolio

## Introduction
This personal portfolio project showcases the professional and technical skills of Rain Wang. The website features a modern UI with various sections, including "About", "Experience", "Projects", and "Contact", which provide visitors with a comprehensive view of Rain's profile and achievements. It's a fully responsive site, ensuring a great user experience across different devices.

## Technologies Used
This project was built with:

- React: The main library used for building the user interface.
- CSS: Used for styling the components.
- Axios: Used for making HTTP requests to the API.
- React Router: Used for routing and navigation within the application.

To make the site dynamic and interactive, we've used the following APIs and services:

- GitHub API: To fetch real-time data about Rain's public repositories for the "Projects" section.
- EmailJS API: To handle contact form submissions and send an email directly from the browser without a backend server.


## Future Plans
In the future, the following features could be added to enhance the site:

- Blog Section: A dedicated area where Rain can share knowledge and thoughts about technology, coding, and related topics.
- Skills Section: A visual representation of Rain's skills in various technologies.
- Testimonials: Incorporate feedback or reviews from colleagues or clients.
