# Personal Portfolio Website

## Introduction
This personal portfolio project showcases the professional and technical skills of Rain Wang. The website features a modern UI with various sections, including "About", "Experience", "Projects", and "Contact", which provide visitors with a comprehensive view of Rain's profile and achievements. It's a fully responsive site, ensuring a great user experience across different devices.

## Technologies Used
The website is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. React's component-based architecture is leveraged to create reusable UI components and manage the site's overall structure. CSS is used for styling and providing a clean and modern look to the website.

To make the site dynamic and interactive, we've used the following APIs and services:

- GitHub API: To fetch real-time data about Rain's public repositories for the "Projects" section.
- EmailJS API: To handle contact form submissions and send an email directly from the browser without a backend server.

## Most Difficult Part
The most challenging part of the project was managing state and ensuring that the data fetched from APIs is correctly integrated and displayed on the website. Especially with GitHub's API, where we had to fetch not only repository data but also the README content, and then process it to extract live site links.

## Favourite Part
The favorite part of developing this project was designing the user interface and building a smooth and responsive site. Watching the site come alive with animations and transitions was a particularly rewarding experience.

## Future Plans
In the future, the following features could be added to enhance the site:

- Blog Section: A dedicated area where Rain can share knowledge and thoughts about technology, coding, and related topics.
- Skills Section: A visual representation of Rain's skills in various technologies.
- Testimonials: Incorporate feedback or reviews from colleagues or clients.
